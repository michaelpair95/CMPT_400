Correctness:

- The program produces correct output.

- The program produces output in the correct format.


Style:

- Correct indentation

- Poor block comments

- Both files have incorrect method header formatting. Each function must have a
  comment block before it, which gives the function name, describes each
  parameter and the return value (if any), and explains the purpose of the
  function. Refer to the parameters by name, not by type. Here is an example:
/**
 * factorial
 *
 * This function computes the factorial of the given input. The factorial is
 * defined as factorial(n) = n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1.
 * 
 * Parameters:
 *   n: the number on which to compute the factorial
 * 
 * Return value: the factorial of n, or 1 if n <= 0.
 */
public static int factorial(int n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return 1;
  }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

- Classes do not have a description. Each class declaration must have a comment
  block before it, which gives the class name and describes the purpose of the
  class. Here is an example:
/**
 * SinglyLinkedList
 * 
 * This class implements a linked list with single forward links, and supports
 * dynamic addition and deletion of nodes. 
 */
public class SinglyLinkedList {
  // ...
}


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program is efficient as implemented.

- Your program is supposed to run by taking input as an argument in command
  line, as follows (from the handout):
--
$ java driverDFA gncgwng 
--
but your program is making me do this
--
$ java driverDFA
gncgwng
--
which is not what you were asked to do in the handout.


CSV files:

- CSV files contain State-transition table and description of states.
