Neat DFA diagram in a .pdf
- ok
State-transition table
- ok
Descriptions of each state
- ok
5 test cases accepted by the DFA
- ok
5 test cases rejected by the DFA 
- ok

Analysis
- Good quality of DFA diagram
- Good state descriptions
- Good and efficient construction of the DFA

Completeness 
- Test cases are difficult and interesting
- Includes both correct and incorrect statements
- Includes both correct and incorrect asignments
- Includes both correct and incorrect identifiers

Correctness
- DFA diagram is incorrect:
  > as it stands the DFA does not accept this: p = 0 because it wants anything
  that starts with p be print or else, it rejects it, and that is wrong
- Tables are correct
- Test cases are correct


Additional comments:
- Extra points for making me laugh with the "rating" thing
